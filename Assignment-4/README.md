## Assignment-4
The goal of this assignment is to correctly identify numerical digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We make use of the classic dataset MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") to train the model. I made use of Keras library to build the model. I used several convolutional layers and applied Adam optimiser on the Categorical Crossentropy loss function. I achieved 99.69% training accuracy and 97.80% validation accuracy. On using the test dataset, my model achieved 97.94% accuracy. I've attached the Kaggle score, code and the prediction csv here.
