# VIRUS SPREAD SIMULATION
   This project aims to simulate a basic model of a virus spreading across 15,000 people. We model it as a 100 X 150 matrix containing 15,000 cells.
  It is given that one of the cells is infected, the chance of first neighbouring cells to get affected is 25% and the chance for the second neighbouring cells to get affected is 8%. Infected people can travel and be the carriers of the virus. This makes transmission even faster. We take that into account by randomly swapping 8 cells with another 8 in every iteration. This model would be able to calculate the number of people infected and the increase in number with each iteration. It would also plot the data and calculate when the increase would be maximum. This model could be further extended to predict the rate at which the transmission occurs. The below graphs are plotted by the designed model.
