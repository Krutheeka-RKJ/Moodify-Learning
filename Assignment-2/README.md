## ASSIGNMENT 2
In 1998, the Adventure Works Cycles company collected a large volume of data about their existing customers, including demographic features and information about purchases they have made. The analysis should endeavor to determine whether a customer's average monthly spend with the company can be predicted from known customer characteristics.

Challenge 1: Explore the data and gain some insights into Adventure Works customer characteristics and purchasing behavior. I used data visualisation techniques, graphs to derive some relationships in the data. They are given in the .ipynb file.

Challenge 2: Build a regression model to predict customer purchasing behavior. The model made predictions which is also added in .csv format.
